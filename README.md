# mst_upscayl
This repository contains the Sets 1-6 from the [Mnemonic Similarity Task](https://github.com/celstark/MST) and the [Optimized MST](https://github.com/celstark/oMST), but up-scaled using the AI-based [Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl) algorithm.  The original output is in the `4x_png` folder. These have been converted to JPG (`4x_jpg`) and also down-sampled to 2x (`2x_jpg`) using GraphicsMagick.
